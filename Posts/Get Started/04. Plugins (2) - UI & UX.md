# Advanced new file

Obsidian's default `Create new note` feature creates a note without allowing you to choose a file name and location. The location is determined by the setting.

However, since I wanted to organize related notes (memos) into folders, I needed a feature that would allow me to specify the save location when creating a new note. This [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-advanced-new-file) makes it easy by prompting for the save location.

Assigning this command to the existing **Ctrl(Cmd) + N** shortcut makes it even more convenient. Additionally, it offers autocomplete using the tab key, so you don't have to type everything out manually, which is another advantage.

# Calendar

Another advantage of Obsidian is that it provides a built-in daily note feature. This [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=calendar) offers a calendar UI and creates a daily note for the selected date when clicked.

Without this plugin, you can only create a daily note for the current day. If you want to create a daily note for a future date, you have to manually name the file. With this plugin, you can simply click on a future date and it will create a daily note for that day.

# Homepage

브라우저의 홈페이지처럼, Obsidian을 처음 실행했을 때 특정 페이지가 나타나게 해주는 기능이다. 나같은 경우에는 작업 중이던 페이지가 나타나는 것도 좋지만, Obsidian이 실행되었을 때 내 모든 할 일(To-Do)들이 보이면 좋을 것 같다는 생각에 설치한 [플러그인]()이다.

순수 마크다운만으로는 Obsidian에서 내 모든 할 일들을 표시하는 것은 불가능하다. 하지만 아래에서 소개할 [[#Tasks]] 플러그인으로 이를 가능하게 할 수 있다.

두 플러그인을 같이 활용하여 나는 다음과 같이 Obsidian 실행 시 모든 할 일들을 볼 수 있도록 구성할 수 있었다.

This [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=homepage) allows a specific page to appear when Obsidian is first launched, similar to the browser homepage. Since I wanted to see all of my To-Do items when I launched the application, I installed the this plugin and [[#Tasks]] plugin together.

It's not possible to display all of my tasks in Obsidian using only pure Markdown. However, this can be achieved with the [[#Tasks]] plugin, which I will introduce below.

# Hotkey Helper

This [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=hotkey-helper) doesn't have much to explain, but it's powerful. It shows the hotkeys that conflict when setting up hotkeys in Obsidian.

# Minimal Theme Settings

This [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-minimal-settings) allows me to customize the "Minimal" theme that I use. Through this plugin, I was able to change the default Minimal theme.

# Recent Files

This is a [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=recent-files-obsidian) that allows you to view recent files in Obsidian. I was surprised that Obsidian doesn't support this feature by default.

# Settings Search

I think this [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=settings-search) might be adopted as an official plugin in the future. By default, Obsidian does not have a search function in the settings menu, but this plugin provides a search bar for it.

# Style Settings

This [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings) allows you to customize the style in a more detailed way. Unlike Notion, where customization is almost impossible, I think that the ability to customize is one of Obsidian's strengths.

# Tasks

This [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin) provides a feature to view To-Do lists for a vault or a specific folder by using dedicated queries. It also offers an autocomplete function when creating To-Do items to specify start and end dates.

For me, as I mentioned in my [[#Homepage]] note, I use it to show my to-dos and completed tasks on my homepage. I don't use the start and end date features because they are a bit cumbersome, so I mainly manage my To-Do items by writing them in my daily notes.

# Templater

This [plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=templater-obsidian) provides powerful template functionality. While Obsidian already has a template feature, this plugin takes it one step further by allowing programmable things like dynamic text, moving cursor's position.
