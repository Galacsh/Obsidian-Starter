# Editing Hotkeys

Assigned `Cmd + single key` for editing, similar to using `Cmd + B` for bold in most text editors.

| Hotkey                | Command                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Cmd + B`             | **Bold**                                                                      |
| `Cmd + I`             | _Italic_                                                                      |
| `Cmd + -`             | ~~Strikethrough~~                                                             |
| `Cmd + .`             | Bulleted List                                                                 |
| `Cmd + /`             | Numbered List                                                                 |
| `Cmd + ;`             | Toggle Checkboxes                                                             |
| `Cmd + L`             | Link (==L==ink)                                                               |
| `Cmd + Enter(Return)` | Open link if cursor is on a link, create a new note if the link doesn't exist |
| `Cmd + E`             | Toggle Edit/Preview mode                                                      |

## For List Editing

OneNote's advantage is that it makes it very easy to work with lists. While Obsidian doesn't offer the same level of convenience as OneNote, you can still have a similar experience with the Outliner plugin and keyboard shortcuts.

For list editing, I've assigned the `Command + Option` key combination to the following functions:

| Shortcut            | Command                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `Cmd + Opt + =`     | Expand list                 |
| `Cmd + Opt + -`     | Collapse list               |
| `Cmd + Opt + Left`  | Outdent                     |
| `Cmd + Opt + Right` | Indent                      |
| `Cmd + Opt + Up`    | Move list and sublists up   |
| `Cmd + Opt + Down`  | Move list and sublists down |

# No Hotkey, but Easy as is

## Code

### Inline Code

Select text, then type backtick(\`)

```markdown
`String hello = "world";`
```

`String hello = "world";`

### Block Code

~~~markdown
```language
Code here
```
~~~

or

```markdown
~~~language
Code here
~~~
```

## Highlight

Select text, then type `==`

```markdown
Highlight ==here==!
```

Highlight ==here==!

## Table Editing

Let's say `I` denotes the cursor position in the following example:

```markdown
|Column 1I
```

Pressing the `Tab` key will allow you to write in the next column, and pressing `Enter(Return)` will allow you to write in the next row. To move cursor outside the table, you can press `Shift + Enter`.

> [!tip]  
> To format the markdown code for a table after creating it, you can open the Command Palette and select `Format all tables in this file`, or press `Cmd + Opt + L`.

> [!info]
> - It is recommended not to use shortcuts 1 and 2 for list editing
>     - For list editing, use `Command + Option` key combination
> - There is no need to assign a hotkey for formatting markdown
>     - Markdown formatting is automatically done upon saving with `Cmd + S`

# Synchronization-related Hotkeys

For synchronization, `Cmd + Shift + S` shortcut key is assigned.
