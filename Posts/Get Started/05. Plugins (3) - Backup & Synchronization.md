# Obsidian Git

It was tricky to synchronize between devices without using the Obsidian Sync feature. However, among many plugins, I decided to use the [Obsidian Git](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-git) that worked the best for me.

There is a way to automatically backup my work to a Git repository using scheduling, but in this starter, I set it up to backup manually.
